# Team-Profile-Generator
# Description
### This application is designed to create an entire team profile web page all from within the command line! It's a command line based application that I created using Javascript, the whole process takes place in various files within the repo. After answering all the questions about the team members' info, the user only needs to check within the dist folder to find their newly generated team profile page!
